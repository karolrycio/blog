### 1. Introduction ###
It's been over 3 months when I published my last post. In chaos of daily jobs I 
realize that there is so much things that I don't like in Google Blogger that I 
have to find different solution for my blogging aspirations. So first of all 
requirements, what do I hate most in Blogger:

   * __editor__ - I used to vim and cannot stand that there is no bracket matching,
vertical/block modification, and other cool stuff that I use
   * __the way that page was stored__ - I want to have control on my blog and if I can 
use for example git to track its content that would be great
   *  __lamish__ - with Blogger I learned nothing, I look for something related with new 
trends in web development, it looks that ruby on rails is the most interesting 
framework

And I found [Octopress](http://octopress.org) it has all I need. The page states 
"A blogging framework for hackers". I don't know if I can or should call myself 
hacker but the idea is great for me.

So I start to move my blog to Octopress. Of course there is a plenty of things 
to do but also many to learn.

Lets start with first part of hints that I found useful:

### 2. Blogger post conversion to markdown and import to Octopress ###
__Update__: _after I wrote this post I found interesting article on [this page](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations)_

* Export Blogger posts. 
To do this go to your blog `Design->Settings->Other->Export blog->Donwload blog`
* Convert xml to html files.
I used latest modification of [import.rb](https://gist.github.com/dnagir/1765496/forks)
but you probably can find better solution.
* Convert html files to markdown for example by using [reverse_markdown](https://github.com/xijo/reverse_markdown):
```bash
sudo gem install reverse_markdown
d path/with/your/html/files
find -name &quot;*.html&quot; | sed -e &#039;s/.html//&#039; | xargs -n 1 -I @ sh -c &#039;reverse_markdown @.html &gt; @.markdown&#039;
mv *.markdown path/to/your/octopress/source/_posts/
```
* At the end of this process you should take a look at generated code, so setup 
  your octopress and run `rake preview`
* Fix syntax and enjoy your posts in markdown.
    * useful thing here for me was markdown syntax highlighting in vim by tpope
    [vim-markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown)
    * liquid syntax [vim-liquid](https://github.com/tpope/vim-liquid)
    * also setting spellchecker could be useful, add below line to your `$HOME/.vimrc`
    and you will get spell cheking with en_us dictionary and word wraping on 80 
    character:
```
&quot; blogging with markdown
au BufRead,BufEnter *.markdown setlocal textwidth=80 formatoptions+=w spell spelllang=en_us
```
### 3. Octopress configuration - tricks that I used for this blog ###
* Configure your social networks as it was explained in [Octopress documentation](http://octopress.org/docs/configuring)
* It is good to register on [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) the idea of keeping 
comments separated from blog is very good. I realized it when was trying 
migrate my comments from Blogger and didn't have installed Disqus.
* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/)
also are very helpful in tracking how your content was shared and what of this 
stuff has greatest interest. I will write article how to integrate [AddThis](http://www.addthis.com/)
because there is lack of information about it in google.
* Header background image can be changed by dealing with sass files. I did this 
in `sass/custom/_layout.scss` using below lines:
```css
body &gt; header[role=&quot;banner&quot;] {
    background-image: url(/images/header_bg2_1200x168.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
* If you add some background you probably want to set position of your title and 
  subtitle. You can do this in the same file as background image using something 
  like this:
```css
body &gt; header h2 {
    position:relative;
    padding-left:6.6em;
}

body &gt; header h1 {
    font-weight:bold;
    position:relative;
    padding-left:3em;
}
```
* Do not forget about updating your Octopress frequently. Instructions how to do
  that can be found in [documentation](http://octopress.org/docs/updating/)

### 4. SEO ###
Most interesting article about SEO is surprisingly on top of google search ['octopress seo'](http://www.yatishmehta.in/seo-for-octopress).
Main thing that I take from the article is that Octopress already have built in
support for SEO by additional elements in post header. This elements are `keywords:, description:`
for example:
```
---
layout: post
post_title: &quot;Another blogger switched to Octopress&quot;
post_date: 2013-03-19 03:01
comments: true
categories: &quot;about this blog&quot;
published: false
keywords: blog,octopress,blogger,configuration,seo,tricks
description: Octopress configuration
---
```
Octopress will use keywords and description to build meta section of every 
website on your blog.

To not forget keyword and description section in my posts I modified Rakefile:
```diff
diff --git a/Rakefile b/Rakefile
index d3a1cb0..3e2ced7 100644
--- a/Rakefile
+++ b/Rakefile
@@ -111,6 +111,9 @@ task :new_post, :title do |t, args|
     post.puts &quot;date: #{Time.now.strftime(&#039;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M&#039;)}&quot;
     post.puts &quot;comments: true&quot;
     post.puts &quot;categories: &quot;
+    post.puts &quot;published: false&quot;
+    post.puts &quot;keywords:&quot;
+    post.puts &quot;description:&quot;
     post.puts &quot;---&quot;
   end
 end
```

### 5. Others ###
Few things that were not so obvious for me:

* to create category name that contain few words like `about this blog` syntax 
like this:
```
categories:
 - about this blog
```
not like this:
```
categories: about this blog # or &quot;about this blog&quot;
```
* ordered and unordered lists are not indented by default, this code in `sass/custom/_layout.scss`
fix this behavior:
```css
article {
  ol, ul {
    padding-left: 3em;
  }
}
```

Hope this tips are useful for you.
